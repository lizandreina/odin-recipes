# odin-recipes

My first HTML site - later added some CSS!

This is my first project in my The Odin Project learning journey where I built an HTML site with three recipes.

After learning a lot of theory up until this point, I finally got to put to work my newly learned skills:

- Using Bash commands.
- Doing atomic commits, writing good commit messages and pushing changes on GitHub.
- Using HTML and later adding some CSS.
- Publishing the site from the GitHub repository.

Reflection: There is no rush in learning!
