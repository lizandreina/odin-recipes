# odin-recipes

This is my first project in my The Odin Project learning journey where I built an HTML site with three recipes: arepas, avocado sandwiches, and pumpkin soup.

After learning a lot of theory up until this point, I finally got to put into work my newly learned skills:

- Using Bash commands: Created the folders and files with Bash and started using the terminal in Visual Studio to speed up the process.
- Doing atomic commits: Staged and commited on Git after I finished working on each recipe and added it in the index file. Also used the git log command to check previous commits and git status command to check pending modifications to commit.
- Writing good commit messages: Using the best practices, I separated subject from body, used the imperative mood, and used the body to explain the what instead of the how.
- Pushing changes on GitHub: Pushed changes to GitHub so others can see my project on the platform along with the commits.
- Using HTML: Used headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, links, and image tags and elements to create the recipes and index pages. Also italicized and bolded text.
- Publishing site: Published the project on the web from the GitHub repository.


Reflection: There is no rush in learning and advancing is the win.
