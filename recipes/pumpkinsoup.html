    <h2>Description</h2>

    Another easy recipe (my faves!) which I love for <em>winter</em>. You need a blender though! ðŸ‘€

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbs extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2kg pumpkin, peeled, chopped</li>
            <li>4 cups (1L) chicken stock</li>
            <li>Pure (thin) cream and chopped fresh chives, to serve</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook onion, stirring, for 5 minutes or until softened. Add pumpkin. Cook, stirring for 3 minutes or until starting to brown slightly.</li>
        <li>Add stock. Season with salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper. Bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes until pumpkin is tender.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Using a stick blender, carefully blend soup until very smooth. Serve drizzled with cream and sprinkled with chives.</li>
    </ol>
