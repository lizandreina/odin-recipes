    <h2>Description</h2>

    I was born in Venezuela and I remember eating arepas in my grandmother's house since I was very young. Later, I have lived in other countries and even though I haven't been to Venezuela in 10 years, every time I eat one I can't help but travel back home. Bonus: No matter the nationality, whoever I've suggested trying them loves them. You can't go wrong with these! 

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.</li>
        <li>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
